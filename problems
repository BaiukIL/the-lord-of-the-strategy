1. ImportError
2. Is it better to create Minimap class than make it from window in interface?
(Same question to Selected and Command)
3. How to be with borders? I always have to consider them when draw something on surface.
From the other side if i store _bordered field I have to remember that I should use draw_image
instead of image.blit() (bad idea)
